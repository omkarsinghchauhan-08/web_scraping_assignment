    "# what is web scrapping \n",
    "#ans - Web scraping is an automatic method to obtain large amounts of data from websites. Most of this data is unstructured data in an HTML format which is then converted into structured data in a spreadsheet or a database so that it can be used in various applications. There are many different ways to perform web scraping to obtain data from websites. These include using online services, particular API’s or even creating your code for web scraping from scratch. Many large websites, like Google, Twitter, Facebook, StackOverflow, etc. have API’s that allow you to access their data in a structured format. This is the best option, but there are other sites that don’t allow users to access large amounts of data in a structured form or they are simply not that technologically advanced. In that situation, it’s best to use Web Scraping to scrape the website for data.\n",

    "#         You don’t have to invest in costly physical services. Instead, you can create virtual machines with Amazon EC2 while managing other server features such as ports, security, and storage. Spend less time maintaining your servers and more time on your strategic projects. Invariably, Amazon EC2 is one of the most popular and fastest-growing of the many AWS services.\n",

By using this AWS service, you can create dedicated instances of databases within minutes. Not to mention, these instances can support multiple database engines including SQL Server, SQL, PostgreSQL, and more. Take your time back and stop spending hours maintaining your database servers. Let Amazon RDS do the work for you.\n",

Amazon Simple Storage Service (S3) has come to the rescue. It makes sense why this would be included in our list of the top 10 most used AWS services. It offers a highly secure and redundant file storage service. It also stores data in three data centers within a specific region. And, there’s more. Amazon S3 also offers integrations to help prevent breaches by way of PCI-DSS, HIPAA/HITECH, and FedRAMP. You get data flexibility without almost zero latency.\n",
